                    Prostatitis usually goes into a chronic form which is accompanied by pain and suffering for  many years . Most important  will be to determine the pathogen where exactly the reason of inflammation and irritation in prostate is. After the detailed diagnostic and isolation pathogens, treatment is then continued. The scientific article describes in detail the diagnosis and treatment: <br>

                    The treatment technology includes the preparation of a highly immunogenic conjugate. This speciffically increases in body high level and titre of antibodies and these antibodies fight the cause of inflammation. 
                    As a result, the bacteria caused inflammation of the prostate gland leaves the prostate after a while. In most patients with prostatitis, after such treatment, there is no attack in the prostate by bacteria.

                    <p class="article__text">The prostatitis syndrome is not a figment of your imagination as insurance companies and many ignorant practitioners would like you to believe. For every effect there is an exact cause!</p>
                    <p class="article__text">
                    Despite what people tell you, there is a damn good reason why 40% of all prostatitis cases are not resolved with antibiotics alone. When this cause remains hidden, the wrong treatment needlessly perpetuates suffering for decades if not the rest of people's lives. If you are reading this address you already realize chronic infection will not just go away on its own or through the use of some antibiotic cure all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__text">
                    When patients don't respond to antibiotics there is always a reason why. The prostatitis syndrome is caused by various bacteria, funguses, and viruses, as well as, mixed infections. Antibiotics can't suppress the plunder of a viral or or fungal infection, likewise, they are virtually useless on severely resistant bacteria.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__text">
                    Here at "Androgen" there is no guess work, we use only the best diagnostics available to find the precise cause of suffering. Isolation of the exact pathogens proves every diagnosis we make. "Androgen" uses all available technology to try to cure every patient we treat. All our time and energy centers around this single task. We develop and improve new treatment technologies for chronic prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis, using the most advanced technology available. "Androgen" is not financed by the state or other institutions, therefore we can not provide our services free of free-of-charge. Many patients want to receive our treatment, without having the necessary funds. Unfortunately, we can not accept these patients because the use of the latest technologies is prohibitively expensive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__text">
                    Our new technologies make use of expensive chemical reagents and nutrient media made in USA (by Sigma and Becton Dickinson), for the production of high-immunogen conjugates that are suited only for the patient it is produced for. It is the cost of these raw materials that make up the majority of the cost of treatment. We have no control over these costs since they are dictated to us by Sigma and Becton Dickinson. We provide these chemical reagents and medias to you at our cost; you can verify this fact independently. Each conjugate produced is unique to all others based on the specific (isolated from each patient) bacteria, fungus, or virus it is intended to treat. This reality makes high immunogen conjugates impossible to mass produce, and so, the lack of economies of scale make the production of each conjugate extremely expensive.

                    <h2 class="article__title">Traditional Methods of treatment of Prostatitis and <br> Seminal vesiculitis are grossly inadequate</h2>
                    <p class="article__text">Traditional methods of treatment of inflammatory processes in the prostate and seminal vesicles by antibiotics are still widely used. Treatment by antibiotics is only justified in acute cases, where it is a matter of life or death.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">The repeated use of antibiotics for a chronic inflammatory process in the prostate and seminal vesicles destroys beneficial bacteria such as Bifidumbacterium, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus in the intestines, and so, frequently causes disbacteriosis in the intestines.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">In disbacteriosis the balance of bacterial types in the patient is broken, and so, beneficial bacteria perish. In their place pathogenic bacteria and viruses take hold. Over the years parasites populate the intestines and other parts of the body rendering a negative influence on many of the patient's normal systems. This cycle can go on for decades without amelioration.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">This has become our working concept. It is confirmed by our research and the research of our colleagues. Typically chronic prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis is treated by using several courses of antibiotics like: Cipro, Ciprolet, Ciprobid, Ciprobay (Cyprofloxacin), Cefobid, Ofloxacin (Tarivid), Trovan, Norfloxacin, and other types of antibiotics like Metronidazole (Flagyl, Tinidazol) are also widely used. The Bacteria have the ability to form a resistance - "to get used" to the repeated actions of antibiotics, therefore frequent use reduces the therapeutic effect to zero. Our research has shown that the use of antibiotics drastically hinders the function of the liver, kidneys, blood and most importantly suppresses the protective functions of the immune system.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">We have found it possible to avoid the application of antibiotics all together for our treatment of chronic prostatitis and chronic vesiculitis. The use of antibiotics for chronic inflammatory processes does not eradicate pathogenic bacteria in a patient. Antibiotics only delay the duplication and growth of bacteria, and so, do not provide a permanent solution. Once antibiotics are stopped the same bacteria again multiply in the patient's body and cause a relapse of prostatitis and vesiculitis. For this reason, antibiotics are prescribed over and over again over many years and still do not solve the problem. It is important to note that antibiotics do not influence viruses at all. You can take antibiotics for the rest of your life, but it will do you no good if your symptoms are caused by a virus.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">During treatment of chronic prostatitis and vesiculitis we use physiotherapeutic procedures as an auxiliary factor to increase the effectiveness of our treatments.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">We have included a combination of physiotherapeutic procedures and use these if necessary:</p>
                    <p class="article__text">1) Rectal ultrasonic medical procedures on the areas of prostate and seminal vesicles is useful in reducing calcification in prostate and normalizing the overall structure.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">2) Weak medical infrared laser over the lower abdomen. It helps stimulate the immunoprotective functions and suppress pathogens.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">3) Medical amplitude impulses (stimulating therapy). Suppress inflammation, reduce pain and normalize nervous system function in pelvic area.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">4) Medical electrophoresis (iongalvanization). This procedure allows the diffusion of certain substances in the body (e.g. ZnSO4 (restores nervous system function in pelvic area), KI (anti-inflammatory), Novocain, etc.) through the lower abdomen and lower back with the aid of a static electric field.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">The use of such physiotherapeutic procedures is necessary especially when there are inflammatory stones in the prostate, and also:</p>
                    <p class="article__text">1) Helps the infiltration of the prostatic capsule (electrophoresis),</p>
                    <p class="article__text">2) When the prostatic tissue is not homogeneous,</p>

                    <h2 class="article__title">New concepts and technology for treatment of <br> prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis in young men:</h2>
                    <p class="article__text">Our new technological treatment of prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis is based on the fundamental understanding of clinical immunology. High immunogen conjugates, made by the Androgen Scientific Research Group- are used to influence the action on specific pathogens involved in prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis this stimulates the specific immune response of the patient. In the process, pathogenic agents of prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis are eradicated.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">The use of high immunogen conjugates facilitate the stabilization of normal microflora in the inflamed area. This provides the patient a long period of resistance to microorganisms for which we have provided immune protection. Our use of high immunogen conjugates against agents in prostatitis and vesiculitis represents a new and highly effective method of treatment that is far superior to antibiotics. We carry out detailed virological, bacteriological and mycological (fungal) diagnostics on semen to identify the types of bacteria, fungi or viruses responsible for the infection. There is no guess work involved in our diagnostic methods, all treatments are based on the isolation of specific pathogens. We extract, select, and isolate the infective agent from semen, urine, and EPS (Express Prostatic Secretions). After we have selected pathogenic bacteria, fungi or viruses alive we prepare high immunogen conjugates from these isolated microorganisms for each patient.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">The technological process of preparation of high immunogen conjugates depends upon the type of infection for the specific patient. This process takes time approximately as follows:</p>
                        <ol class="article__text">
                            <li>For bacteria - up to 1 month;</li>
                            <li>For fungi: 1-2 month (It depends on the kind of fungus);</li>
                            <li>For viruses: 2-3 months (It depends on the kind of viruses).</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p class="article__text">Before beginning treatment we do a detailed assessment of all aspects of the patient's immune system. We carefully estimate the condition of the immune system by checking the cell and humoral immunity that indicates natural resistance. Taking into account specific immunological problems, we choose the appropriate type of immunological correction. If a patient has autoimmune diseases or if the patient is sensitive to the tested bacterial, viral and fungal antigens, we carry out desensitization with specific antigens.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Only after desensitization do we begin generating active specific immunity for the microorganisms involved in the patient's disease.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">We begin manufacture of the high immunogen conjugates only after the patient pays the cost of Chemical Reagents and Nutrient Media for bacterial, fungal or viruses cultures. The reagents and medias are an indispensable part of generating high immunogen conjugates. The course of treatment consists of 3 intramuscular injections with an interval of 10 days between injections.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Contra-indications for use of our high immunogen conjugates are allergies or predisposition to allergic diseases.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Our treatment is highly individualized and entails significant labor cost in the preparation of immunogen conjugates. The material cost for the reagents used in the preparations of the conjugates are also very expensive.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">As a result, we can only treat a small number of patients. Typically, a patient stays for three weeks, and in this period he is the only patient treated. This allows us to monitor each patient's progress on a continuous basis so we can direct all our efforts on curing him. The nature and method of our treatment involves significant cost, and therefore, is addressed only to persons with the necessary financial means. The cost of manufacture of high immunogen conjugates directly depends on the types of microorganisms isolated from the individual patient during detailed diagnostics. It is calculated in each specific case individually.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Our methods can resolve the problems of individuals who have been unsuccessfully treated for prostatitis and seminal vesiculitis, because our treatments overcome the problem of antibiotic resistance and serve to effectively eradicate viral causes that thus far have not been treated.</p>

                    <h2 class="article__title">Our conceptual approach to the treatment of recurring prostatitis <br> due to viral, bacterial or fungal infections.</h2>
                    <p class="article__text">Our new concept has been carefully refined and tested for over ten years.:</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Our new conceptual approach focuses on the treatment of chronic prostatic infection by viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens without the use of antibiotics.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Our purpose: Forming specific immunity protection to the chronic relapse of prostatitis caused by viral, bacterial or fungal infections based on individual immunoreactivity of CP sufferers.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">To achieve our purpose we perform the following tasks:</p>
                    

                    <ol class="article__text">
                        <li>Check the status of cellular and humoral immunity in general. Identify any allergic sensitization to specific viruses-bacteria-fungi to antigens. Determine status of cells that determine natural resistance of the body (by measuring cell toxicity from activity of " killer cells (CD+25) and functional status of macrophages (mononuclear cells and phagocytes)).</li>
                        <li>From the analysis of the immune status of the patient we can determine the required immunocorrective therapy. We use medicines which primarily influence the T cell (CD3+) immunity link, humoral immunity, and natural resistance.</li>
                        <li>If the patient is allergic (highly sensitive) to viral, bacterial or fungal infective agents we follow a specific desensitization therapy as a first step, prior to the onset of conjugate therapy.</li>
                        <li>After immune tests we can determine if the systemic patient immunity is satisfactory, we proceed with specific immune therapy employing specific viral, bacterial or fungal high immunogen conjugates once we deem the function of the immune system to be normal. These conjugates generate significant amounts of antibodies, specific to the isolated pathogen.</li>
                        <li>Taking into account the initial level of immune status of the patient we make individual selection of dosage of high immunogen conjugate (by checking the reaction of CD-3 (T-cells) and other effectors for viral, bacterial or fungal high immunogen conjugates).</li>
                        <li>In some cases, when we can not receive the necessary level of desensitization and immune correction (by a series of antigen shots) we use a combination of low doses of high immunogen conjugates, and immune modulators (alpha - 2 recombinant interferon etc.). The result is an increase in the receptor cells that help to reduce inflammation, while generating sufficient number of antibodies to fight the pathogens.</li>
                        <li>We perform an immune reaction control test to monitor the status of the patient's body and determine the rate of the subsequent introduction of viral, bacterial or fungal immunogen conjugates.</li>
                        <li>We administer physio-therapeutical procedures before and after specific immune therapy.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="article__text">Antibiotic treatments are often marked with relapsed bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections. Furthermore, the traditional methods of treatment with antibiotics often lead to undesirable complications (disbacteriosis in intestines, allergic reactions in the body, decrease of activity immune status in patient body etc.). Our approach, on the other hand relies on employing the body's own healing powers for the treatment of microbial infections. Our new conceptual approach involves the creation of an individual system of natural protection against viruses, bacteria, and fungi with the formation of specific antibodies without antibiotics or toxic anti-viral medications. (e.g. acyclovir, famvir, zovirax, etc.)</p>

                    <p class="article__text">Over the years, we have had a lot of correspondence with CP sufferers from various countries, who all agree that the use of antibiotics has not resulted in any lasting improvement of prostatitis symptoms. When antibiotics fail, it is necessary for experts to look for a viral or fungal infections in the prostate or seminal vesicles. The use of antibiotics disturb or even eradicate the intestinal flora that play an essential role in the metabolism of the body and thus has a detrimental effect on the immune system's balance. Pathogenic fungal overgrowth often replaces the compromised or eradicated beneficial bacterial flora. At other times, pathogenic overgrowth of bacteria or viruses dominates and a mixed bacterial-viral infection can ensue. In such cases we perform detailed virological tests that require special nutrient media, special cell lines, special laboratory utensils and sets of reagents. These materials are very expensive but are essential for the accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment of CP sufferers. We currently import the necessary equipment for detailed virological diagnostic reagents from the USA (Sigma Chemical Company) and other US companies, unfortunately their prices are very expensive and constantly continue to increase.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">So, for example, receiving only one special cell line culture from the European cell line bank (Great Britain) cost - 450 pounds, if 6 lines are necessary for the tests, it accordingly will make - 2700 pounds or ~ 4000$USA. These costs are significant, and so, not every patient can afford it.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Virological tests are not covered by the insurance plans of the patient living in the US and other countries, because of their significant cost (Approximate cost of a set of complex virological tests including all necessary reagents for one patient can reach eight thousand US dollars and sometimes exceed that amount.) The majority of CP sufferers are not capable to pay for such modern diagnostics, therefore the cause of their suffering remains hidden. Absent diagnostics leads to the wrong diagnosis and treatment, and so, the problem of chronic prostatitis is perpetuated for many decades. The bulk of the cost of treatment is put towards purchasing the necessary reagents, nutrient media, and laboratory utensils for diagnostics and the production of conjugates. These reagents and medias will be provided to you at our cost. These prices are dictated by the manufacturers of the necessary reagents and medias and can be verified independently.</p>

It is not capable of secretion of protective antibodies, and therefore there is no hope for spontaneous cure from this chronic infection. The immune system can only secrete seroconversive antibodies, which do not give any real help or protection against the caustive Chlamydial agent.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">Doctors often try ameliorate this problem with antibiotics and non-specific stimulation of the immune system. This treatment can not provide lasting relief to patients because Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae often become completely resistance to antibiotics. Therefore after one or two courses of antibiotics resistance develops and further use of antibiotics is useless. Antibiotics only produces temporary results. While the patient is taking antibiotics, improvement is observed, but after antibiotics are stopped Chlamydia continues on its course unscathed, the only difference being that now the Chlamydia is resistent to antibiotics. Furthermore, antibiotics suppress the cellular link of the immune system. Frequently mixed Chlamydia and viral infections are present. In these cases antibiotics do not even have the capability to help, they only make the problem worse. Chlamydia is not a typical bacterial infection, and so does not respond to antibiotics like a normal bacterias do. Chlamydias have many qualities of a viruses, and so, respond better to treatment normally used to treat viruses.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">The use of antibiotics leads to disfunction of bacterial balance in intestines. Antibiotics disturb and may even eradicate this intestinal flora - a phenomenon known as disbacteriosis. This intestinal flora plays an essential role in the body metabolism and thus affects the immune system balance. Eradicated intestinal bacteria are replaced by pathogenic viruses, fungus, and bacteria causing a mixed infection in the body. Our group avoids the use of antibiotics all together. We extract chlamydial antigens (thermoresistent protein) from the particular infective agent. We provide specific immunoprotection to Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia pneumoniae by creating conjugates from the derived antigens.</p>

                    <p class="article__text">There are only a few effective medications that protect the body from viruses. Injections of nature interferone is the best of such remedies. We have received many E-mails from sufferers and experts alike, who all have agreed that synthetic antiviral remedies (endogen inductors of interferone) are useless, if not, harmful.</p>
                    <p class="article__text">It is necessary to note the following:</p>
                    <ol class="article__text">
                        <li>When viruses attack the body of CP sufferers, the immune system immediately begins secreting endogenous interferon in blood.</li>
                        <li>It is necessary to note, that during the course of the chronic infections of CP sufferers the mechanisms of production of endogenous interferon are broken. Hence, there is no point in using the inductors for endogenous interferon of chemical origin, such as:
                            <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                                <li> Acyclovir (Zovirax );</li>
                                <li>Famciclovir (Famvir );</li>
                                <li>Valacyclovir (Valtrex );</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The use of these remedies results in chemical loading of the liver, kidneys, and blood, because the mechanisms for synthesis of endogenous interferon is broken in CP suffers. For this reason, we exclusively recommend natural -Recombinant alpa-2b-Interferon because of its direct action.</li>

                    <h2 class="article__title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
                    
                    <ol class="article__text">
                        <li>What are the "highimmunogen conjugates"? How are they prepared and what is their mechanism of action in the body?<br>
                            The highimmunogen conjugates are prepared from synthesis of ("conjugation")specific microbes (cultured from the patient's samples) and biopeptides. For safety, microbes are killed prior to conjugation. These conjugates, once injected into the patient's body can stimulate production of large amounts of antibodies, specific to the microbes in the conjugates. The prefix "high" denotes the large quantity of conjugates and subsequent large number of antibodies created in the body. These specific antibodies can reach and attack the corresponding microbe strains in all parts of the body.</li>
                        <li>What type of antibodies do they generate?<br>
                            Only seroprotective antibodies directed at the specific microbes. These are antibodies (neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.) with receptors that make them effective "microbe eaters."</li>
                        <li>Why the body cannot generate sufficient number of antibodies on its own (without the help from the conjugates) to rid itself of the infection in the genitourinary tract?<br>
                            Many patients with chronic prostatitis have only seroconvertive antibodies, i.e. antibodies that have lost their receptors necessary for the assimilation and phagocytosis of microbes. This can be an outcome of an autoimmune disease or of an overall depression of the immune status in the patient's body. As a result of the loss of the specific receptors, neutrophils, and lymphocytes cannot neutralize the infective agents and phagocytosis is in this case is incomplete. Furthermore, in the case of Chlamydial infections the body does not naturally have the ability to protect itself at all.</li>
                        <li>What is the role of local immunity?<br>
                            The local immunity refers to the immunity in a certain area of the body, e.g. the genitourinary tract. Many times the local immunity is compromised even though the systemic immunity is satisfactory. If we determine the local immunity to be suppressed, we employ therapeutic measures to restore local immunity, prior to initiation of conjugate therapy. These measures include local physical therapy to normalize the structure of the sexual glands as well as nonspecific immunomodulation with interferon & FIBS, etc. It should be noted that administration of the high immunogen conjugates assists in the restoration of local immunity, also.</li>
                        <li>Why do you review the functionality of patients' immune system prior to treatment? In what category of patients are your methods not recommended?<br>
                            Certainly we would like to accept only patients with normal immune system, but this is rare in CP. Most often, the immune system of CP sufferers has been infringed in its various parts. In those cases we normalize the immune system prior to conjugate therapy. This is important to prevent any possible allergic reactions that could result from our treatment when applied to patients with unacceptable immune system parameters .
                            We refuse treatment to CP sufferers only in cases where there are obvious or latent attributes of allergic diseases. In those cases, desensitization to allergies must precede our immunotherapy.</li>
                        <li>How long does the protection offered by the conjugates last?
                            It depends on the type of high immunogen conjugates. We prepare two variants:
                            <ol>
                                <li>High immunogen conjugates for short action from 6 months to 1 year.</li>
                                <li>High immunogen conjugates for long action from 3 to 5 years.</li>
                                <li>In either case, it is expected the pathogenic microbes to be eliminated from the body of the patient and hence the disease not to return at the end of the action of the conjugates in the body. In some rare cases, re-infection has occurred after the lapse of protection with short-term immunogen conjugates.</li>
                                <li>Are your methods useful for infection in other parts of the genitourinary tract such as the epididymis and vas deferens?<br>
                                    Our immunotherapy is effective throughout the body. Of course, the physical therapy portion of our treatment applies mainly to the treated structures.</li>
                                <li>You state your methods are useful for young men only (under 50 years old). Why is that?<br>
                                    Because after the age of approximately 50 years of age, there is a large risk of tumours in man's sexual glands. We prefer to limit our practice to cases of inflammation prior to onset of sequencial malignancies and tumors.</li>
                                <li>What is the success rate of your treatment?<br>
                                    Over the last five years (a period over which we have consistently used the current methods) we have treated 112 patients. One hundred three of those patients (92%) were completely cured. The remaining 9 (8%) had received only short term-protection immunotherapy and experienced a relapse (re-infection) after the conclusion of the protective action of the immunogen conjugates (6 months to 1 year).</li>
                                <li>What is the typical duration of treatment?<br>
                                    Treatment usually lasts between 2-3 weeks, depending on the complexity of each case.</li>
                                <li>What is the typical cost?<br>
                                    It depends on the complexity of each case, from quantity and kinds (strains) isolated from semen concrete infection, therefore in each specific case the calculation of cost will be carried out strictly individually.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
